# PrimalDual-VertexCover-Implementation
This projects implements the primal dual algorithm for weighted vertex cover.
The explaination of the algorithm can be found in section 2.2 at following link :
http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6820/2013fa/handouts/approx_algs.pdf

Compilation and execution
1> run make file.
2> run the executable named primaldualVC generated

Note: inp-params.txt contains the graph as input for the primal dual algorithm for vertex cover.
